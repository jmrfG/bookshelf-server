# Book Tracking (SERVER)

This is the server side of a CRUD project used to register and track books that I am reading.








# How to Run

Prior to running the server side, you should install all the dependencies by running:

``
    pip install -r requirements.txt
``

Then, run the main.py file:

Note that, since the application works uppon a TCP/IP stack, it'll only function 100% correctly if the server side is already running.
